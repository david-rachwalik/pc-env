# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Standard Removal:     apt remove <package>
# - This command removes the package but leaves behind configuration files. These files are usually stored in /etc, /var, or the user's home directory,
#   depending on the application.

# Complete Removal:     apt purge <package>
# Use this command to remove both the package and its configuration files. This is equivalent to a "clean uninstall" and prevents most leftovers.
# Even after purging, some files (like logs or user-specific data) might still be left behind in non-standard directories.

# Autoremove:           apt autoremove
# This command helps clean up dependencies that were installed along with a package but are no longer needed once the package is removed.

# Autoclean:           apt autoclean
# This command helps clean up the local repository of retrieved package files no longer needed.
# - directories: /var/cache/apt/archives, /var/cache/apt/archives/partial
# Removes only the cached package files that are no longer available in the repositories or are outdated.
# Itâ€™s less aggressive than apt clean because it keeps the most recent versions of package files in the cache.

# Manual Clean-Up:
# Occasionally, manual intervention is needed to delete user data or logs that are not managed by apt.

# - For cleaner uninstalls, always use `purge` instead of `remove` when uninstalling software with apt.
# - Use `autoremove` regularly to keep your system tidy by removing unnecessary dependencies.
